## What is fcode?
- fcode is an adapter for the [lsp‑ai](https://github.com/SilasMarvin/lsp-ai) project. It supports Fitten Code, Cloudflare AI Workers, and other large‑model APIs compatible with the OpenAI interface, such as Meituan’s LongCat, Alibaba’s ModelScope (qwen), Google’s Gemini, OpenAI, etc.

## What benefits does fcode bring?
- Fitten Code, which originally does not work with lsp‑ai, can now be used within lsp‑ai.
- Cloudflare AI Workers, previously unsupported, can also be used with lsp‑ai.
- Quickly and seamlessly switch between different models/APIs.
- Allows setting a local proxy for individual models (friendly for users in mainland China).

## How to use
- Edit the configuration file  

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.fcode
cd ~/.fcode
touch conf.toml
# Copy the contents of conf_example/conf.toml into this file and modify username, password, key, etc. You can add or remove model configurations as needed.
```
